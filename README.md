## OpenCV Project Topics

1. Converting Images to Grayscale
  - Use the color space conversion code to convert RGB images to grayscale for basic image preprocessing.

2. Visualizing Edge Detection
  - Apply the edge detection code to detect and visualize edges in a collection of object images.

3. Demonstrating Morphological Erosion
  - Use the erosion code to show how an image's features shrink under different kernel sizes.

4. Demonstrating Morphological Dilation
  - Apply the dilation code to illustrate how small gaps in features are filled.

5. Reducing Noise in Photos
- Use the denoising code to clean noisy images and compare the before-and-after effects.

6. Drawing Geometric Shapes on Images
- Apply the shape-drawing code to overlay circles, rectangles, and lines on sample photos.

7. Adding Text to Images
  - Use the text overlay code to label images with captions, annotations, or titles.

8. Isolating Objects by Color
  - Apply the HSV thresholding code to extract and display objects of specific colors from an image.

9. Detecting Faces in Group Photos
  - Use the face detection code to identify and highlight faces in group pictures.

10. Outlining Shapes with Contours
  - Apply the contour detection code to outline and highlight shapes in simple object images.

11. Tracking a Ball in a Video
  - Use the HSV-based object detection code to track a colored ball in a recorded video.

12. Highlighting Detected Faces
  - Apply the Haar cascade face detection code to identify and highlight multiple faces in family or crowd       photos.

13. Extracting Contours for Shape Analysis
  - Use contour detection to analyze and outline geometric shapes in hand-drawn images.

14. Applying Image Blurring Techniques
  - Demonstrate various image blurring methods (Gaussian blur, median blur) to soften details in an image.

15. Segmenting Images Based on Contours
  - Use contour detection to separate different sections of an image, like dividing a painting into its distinct elements.

16. Combining Erosion and Dilation for Feature Refinement
  - Apply erosion followed by dilation on an image to refine and smooth out small features.
